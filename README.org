* Deepnet: Simple Unsupervised Binary Deep Belief Networks
	Deepnet is a simple implementation of binary deep belief networks
	built on top of numpy.  The focus is on unsupervised generative
	learning, so there is no 'predict' method, only a 'sample' method.

** Usage
	 >>> import numpy as np
	 >>> import deepnet
	 >>> X = np.random.rand(30, 200)
	 >>> dbn = deepnet.dbn(30, [100, 100])
	 >>> dbn.fit(X)
	 >>> dbn.sample(10)
